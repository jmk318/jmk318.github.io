          <h2>About Myself</h2>
          <p>I'm currently a sophomore student at <a href="https://ai.yonsei.ac.kr/">Yonsei University</a> majoring in artificial intelligence. 
            Previously, I received my high school diploma in Tianjin, China, where I was lucky to interact with many enthusiastic teachers who helped me learn the usefulness
            and joy of robotics. When I was in high school, I came across the news that many people were suffering from cyber-crimes. Hence, starting from the fear that the people
            around me might also be victims of cyber-crime, I wanted to help prevent any further cyber-crimes.
            In the near future, I aim to to create a system that can help detect and warn underlying risks of cyber-crime. Currently, my research interest
            is in anomaly detection using <u><strong>big data analytics</strong></u> and <u><strong>unsupervised machine learning</strong></u>.
          </p>          
          <p> The <a href="https://ai.yonsei.ac.kr/sub3_1_a.php">curriculum</a> I am currently taking at Yonsei University is well structured and provides comprehensive courses, helping me equip 
            essential knowledge and skills about artificial intelligence. Not only do the academic courses help me grow, but also the extracurricular activities help foster my personal and academic growth.</p>

        <h3>Global Intelligence</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.global-intelligence.co.kr/">Global Intelligence</a> is a club that helps students develop leadership through domestic and overseas training programs. I participated in workshops and seminars organized by great speakers, ranging from previous 
        diplomats to the CEO of Casamia.</p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">The logo above is the symbol of the club "Global Intelligence"</p>
        <p>As part of the 21st class of Global Intelligence, I met students from different colleges with diverse majors, which helped me broaden my perspective. The friends I made in this club
          are great companions and sources of inspiration, as their varied academic interests and perspectives encourage me to think out of the box.
          Furthermore, not only was I able to challenge myself to think more critically by talking with academically disciplined students, but was also able to make
          many long-lasting friends.

        <p>By participating in A.I.DA I was able to interact with senior and junior members, which is typically not an easy opportunity because 
        freshmens usually stay at Songdo. The interaction helped bridge the gap between senior and junior members and strengthen the bond.

        <p>The theme of AWS Living Lab Hackathon was to solve the social issue around our community. As college students, we thought
          the topic of publicizing not well-known scholarships and recommending scholarships to student-specific would be an adequate topic. Hence, in our <a href="data/Young9들.pdf" target="_blank">project</a>, we utilized AWS technology to publicize
          scholarship programs in an easier format so that students are able to easy to recognize informations at a glance.

          recent status based on customer sentiment analysis. Using the hugging face model and prompt engineering, we were able to successfully
          crawl data and extract meaningful insights.
